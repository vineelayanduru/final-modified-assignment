      <div class="size"><center>7 Ways Universities Are Engaging Alumni Using Social Media:<center></div>
      </p>
      <center><img src="ways.jpg" alt="ways" /></center>

   <div class="ways grid_12">
    <p class="font2">In the current economy, job security has become somewhat of an oxymoron. Which is one reason why maintaining connections with your old university classmates, especially when you find yourself looking for a new job, can be crucial. Now universities across the country are beginning to use social media tools to engage alumni and build a network of graduates with a shared affinity for the institution.</p>
    <p class="font2">Of course, helping former students stay connected is just one reason universities are turning to social media; fundraising is another, and there are many more. Below is a look at 10 ways higher education is harnessing the power of social media to engage alumni. Let us know of any other ways you have used social media to connect with graduates or your former classmates in the comments below.</p>
    <h3 class="font3">1.Helping Alumni Find Jobs</h3>
    <p class="font2">Though a lot of schools offer their own database of jobs online, many universities are finding LinkedIn to be an effective tool to provide alumni with career resources. And in fact, using LinkedIn means the process is often very hands-off for the schools. In many cases universities create the group and allow the networking magic to take place, with alumni sharing job opportunities by posting information to the group and creating subgroups that are focused to specific career or regional alumni chapters.</p>
    <p class="font2">Keidra Chaney, an emerging media specialist at DePaul University (@depaulalumni), said LinkedIn is by far the school’s biggest success with 5,500 members currently in their alumni network on the site, and about 100 new members joining weekly. Chaney said the community has active job postings for alumni on the hunt for work, and that most jobs are posted by other alumni. The most recent issue of the school's alumni magazine actually focused on how alumni are using social media.</p>

    <h3 class="font3">2. Collaboration and Connecting With Students</h3>
    <p class="font2">Universities are using social media to smooth the transition from being a student to becoming an alumni by helping the two groups connect and collaborate with each other.

         Stanford University law school created its own Facebook-like social network for alumni and students that includes legal wikis that they can collaborate on for specific practices, said Lisa Farris, associate director of web communications and identity at the Stanford law school. The wikis include overviews of different practices, key skill sets and more information that students and alums can share together. Though there is a lot of alumni-to-alumni conversation that takes place on the network, the collaboration between students and alumni is key in positioning the students for their careers, Farris said.</p>
    <p class="font2">M.I.T.  has had similar results with its LinkedIn alumni group, which it allows students to join before they graduate so that they can network with alumni, said Christine Tempesta, director of strategic initiatives at M.I.T.

        Caltech  offers its students similar access to its LinkedIn group. Andrew Shaindlin, who is executive director at the Caltech Alumni Association and also writes a blog on trends in alumni relations, said allowing students and alumni to connect blurs the transition from student to alumni, which makes the transition more fluid.</p>
    <center><img src="2.jpg" alt="1"></center>
    <h3 class="font3">3. Fundraising: From E-mails to Tweets</h3>
    <p class="font2">Though most universities are using social media to connect alumni, getting a tweet from your alma mater’s alumni association asking for a gift to the school may not be far off.

        “It’s a hot topic right now,” said Shaindlin. “If we are using social media to get our messages out, we have to figure out how to incorporate a need for fundraising and support and build that into the stream of information.” Instead of sending out generic mass e-mails, the challenge is moving to personal, one-to-one forms of communication to make it more effective. Shaindlin thinks that social media can achieve that, but alumni who are the recipients of the message have to be ready to accept it through such a new medium.</p>
    <p class="font2">Some schools are experimenting in this area. Brown University used a Facebook Page to engage its alumni as part of its annual fund drive. The school posted to the wall of the Page encouraging alumni to make a gift to the Brown Annual Fund, announcing dollar-for-dollar matches and the end results of the drive.</p>
    <center><img src="3.jpg" alt="1"></center>
    <h3 class="font3">4. Training Alumni To Use Social Media</h3>
    <p class="font2">Of course, for many alumni social media is still brand new. To help its alumni learn how to use social media tools, MSU’s Alumni Career Services office gives tutorials and presentations about how to use social media for a plethora of purposes. Isbell from MSU said the office has done some 25 presentations, engaging 25,000 people – usually piggybacking at events for alumni groups.</p>
    <h3 class="font3">5. Meeting Alumni Where They're At</h3>
    <p class="font2">Some universities are playing a balancing act between using mainstream social sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) and building their own private networks. Should the resources be focused on creating a private social network for alumni or using big networks already available? And which is more effective? The results are mixed, but it all depends on the goal at hand.</p>
    <center><img src="4.jpg" alt="1"></center>
    <p class="font2">As mainstream social sites continue to grow, niche sites created by universities may become irrelevant and burdensome for alumni to use. Plus, building the sites take resources from the universities that could be applied more effectively elsewhere.

    Stanford law school’s own private network for its students and alumni has done well, said Farris from the school. She said this is largely because the content on the network is valuable and exclusive to those that register to use it, such as students sharing class notes. Furthermore, the school hopes to integrate other features, like a curriculum guide that could be synced with the wikis.</p>
   <h3 class="font3">6. Providing Tools To Spread Information</h3>
   <p class="font2">The University of California at Irvine (@UCIFuture) was looking for a way to share information with its alumni and at the same time give themselves more visibility. The result they came up with is a publically available widget that pulls content from the school’s website and is part of a broader campaign to raise $1 billion. Mark Aydelotte, assistant vice chancellor of marketing, said there have been more than 1,000 installs of the widget since March, and that it gives the school much more exposure by spreading to other places on the web.</p>
   <center><img src="5.jpg" alt="1"></center>
   <h3 class="font3">7. Alumni-Generated Content</h3>
   <p class="font2">Another way schools are engaging alumni is by allowing them to produce their own content, which includes things like the wikis at Stanford and photo sharing with the alumni network at other schools.

   The University of Texas at Austin built its own photo sharing site that allows alumni to share photos of themselves showing the school's well-known “hook ‘em, horns” hand gesture, along with a brief bio.</p>
